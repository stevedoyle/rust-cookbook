# Rust Cookbook

A series of Rust snippeets based on the "C++ Cookbook" by D. Ryan Stephens, Christopher Diggins, Jonathan Turkanis, Jeff Cogswell and published by O'Reilly Media Inc.

The goal of this cookbook is to practice and explore the Rust language and how it can be used to solve everyday programming tasks.

The snippets are implemented as tests in the tests directory.

To run everything:

```bash
cargo test
```
